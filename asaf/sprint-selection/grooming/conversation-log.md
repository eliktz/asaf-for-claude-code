## Phase 1: Understanding (Requirements Clarification)

**Claude**: Let me make sure I understand what we're building. You want to add a sprint selection mechanism so that when multiple sprints exist in `/asaf/`, there's an explicit state file (`.current-sprint.json`) that tracks which sprint is active. All ASAF commands will check this file first, and if it's missing, they'll auto-select the most recently modified sprint. Is that accurate?

**Developer**: yes - to be exact: if this file is missing, we will create it with the most recent sprint. the only exception is /asaf-init that creates new sprint and sets it as the current

**Claude**: Excellent clarification! So `/asaf-init` is special - it creates a new sprint and immediately sets it as current. All other commands auto-create the selection file if missing.

**Claude**: Who are the primary users of this feature?

**Developer**: Developers working solo on multiple features in parallel

**Claude**: Got it - solo developers juggling multiple features. That makes sense.

**Claude**: What problem does this solve for them specifically?

**Developer**: They run a command and it accidentally operates on the wrong sprint. I'm also creating visualization of ASAF and I need this for clarity

**Claude**: Perfect - so it's about preventing accidental wrong-context operations, plus making the system clearer for visualization/tooling.

**Claude**: What does success look like for this feature?

**Developer**: all of the above (Developer always knows which sprint is active before running commands, Zero incidents of commands operating on wrong sprint, Clear visual indicator for visualization tool)

**Claude**: Excellent - all three success criteria.

**Claude**: What's explicitly IN scope for this sprint?

**Developer**: this is the scope (New `/asaf-select` command, Auto-selection algorithm, Update all 14 existing commands, Update documentation)

**Claude**: Perfect. What's explicitly OUT of scope?

**Developer**: all of these examples are out of scope (Multi-sprint operations, Sprint history/audit log, Sprint workspaces or grouping, Undo functionality)

**Claude**: Great - clean scope boundaries.

**Claude**: Are there any constraints we need to work within?

**Developer**: yes we need backward compatibility (I don't see why not, challenge me if you think otherwise)
- file should be in /asaf/ I'll leave the format to you
- scan the current ASAF conventions and see that it makes sense

**Claude**: [Scans asaf-core.md for conventions]

**Claude**: Good, I see the conventions:
- State files: JSON format with ISO-8601 timestamps
- Location: Everything sprint-related lives in `/asaf/`
- Hidden files: `.state.json` uses dot-prefix for machine-readable state
- Validation pattern: All commands check state before proceeding

My recommendation for the selection file:
- Location: `/asaf/.current-sprint.json` (follows dot-prefix convention)
- Format: JSON (consistent with `.state.json`)
- Simple schema: Just what's needed - sprint name, timestamp, type

**Developer**: that's fine

**Claude**: One more question on requirements: Are there any existing ASAF features or patterns this needs to integrate with? Specifically: Express mode sprints, any planned features like your visualization, should this file be git-ignored or committed?

**Developer**: let's keep it with full sprints, the visualization will work with this ground truth, this is a developer decision but we can suggest this to the user

## Phase 2: Technical Design

**Claude**: Now let's get into the implementation details. I see two main components:
1. New `/asaf-select` command
2. Auto-selection logic reusable across all commands

Let's start with the `/asaf-select` command. What behavior do you want when the user runs it without arguments? Your spec mentions "interactive mode" showing a list of sprints. Should it show numbered list with prompt, show list with current highlighted, or just display current sprint?

**Developer**: Show list with current sprint highlighted, confirm to keep or choose different. if only single sprint is available, just mention it

**Claude**: Perfect - smart defaults.

**Claude**: For the auto-selection algorithm, when determining which sprint is most recent, should we look at: folder modification time, `.state.json` modification time, or most recent file anywhere in sprint?

**Developer**: what do you think is best? what reflects real work in the sprint?

**Claude**: I think `.state.json` modification time is best because:
1. Reflects actual work (only updated by ASAF commands)
2. Ignores noise (file viewing, IDE indexing)
3. Intentional (only ASAF commands touch it)
4. Already exists (every valid sprint has it)

**Developer**: yes

**Claude**: Now for the validation logic. When a command checks sprint selection and finds `.current-sprint.json` points to a sprint that exists but has corrupted `.state.json`, should we be strict (treat as invalid, auto-select different) or lenient (warn but allow, developer may be fixing)?

**Developer**: Lenient

**Claude**: Good choice - gives developers flexibility to fix issues.

**Claude**: For the `/asaf-init` command integration: Should it always set new sprint as current, only if no selection exists, or prompt the user?

**Developer**: Prompt seems like a good option

**Claude**: Smart - gives control without assumptions.

**Claude**: Should ALL 14 commands validate sprint selection, or only the ones that operate on sprint data? For example, `/asaf-list` lists all sprints (doesn't need current), `/asaf-help` shows help (no context), but `/asaf-status` definitely needs validation.

**Developer**: B (Only commands that read/write sprint data)

**Claude**: Makes sense. So validation goes in groom, impl variants, demo, retro, status, summary. Not in list, help.

**Claude**: When auto-selection runs and finds NO valid sprints, should we create empty file, don't create file, or error and stop?

**Developer**: C (error and stop)

**Claude**: Perfect - fail fast when there's nothing to select.

**Claude**: Last technical question: For `/asaf-select`, what should happen if user tries to select a sprint that's currently in middle of operation (like `/asaf-impl` running)?

**Developer**: A (Allow it immediately, selection takes effect for next command)

**Claude**: Excellent - clean and simple.

## Phase 3: Edge Cases

**Claude**: Let's systematically think through what could go wrong. Starting with filesystem operations - what could go wrong with the `.current-sprint.json` file itself?

**Developer**: can't think of anything else (beyond file corrupted, wrong permissions, manually edited with invalid sprint name)

**Claude**: Good. What about concurrent access scenarios? Like two terminals running commands simultaneously, user deleting sprint while command reads it?

**Developer**: let's keep those concerns out of scope

**Claude**: Smart - keeps it simple. Document as "Commands read selection at start, use throughout execution."

**Claude**: What about sprint validation edge cases? Sprint folder exists but `.state.json` missing, corrupted, wrong schema, weird phase?

**Developer**: nothing here seems fatal (all recoverable with warnings per lenient strategy)

**Claude**: Good. What about auto-selection algorithm edge cases? Multiple sprints with identical modification times, very old timestamps, future timestamps, non-sprint subdirectories in `/asaf/`?

**Developer**: regarding identical times - just pick one, or prompt the user to choose. non-sprint subdirectories is out of scope

**Claude**: Good - I'll go with "pick one deterministically" (alphabetical tiebreaker) to avoid prompts.

**Claude**: What about user input edge cases for `/asaf-select`? Typos, empty string, paths instead of names, canceling interactive selection?

**Developer**: helpful (fuzzy matching for typos)

**Claude**: Perfect. What about special characters and naming edge cases? Spaces, shell special characters, very long names, Unicode?

**Developer**: let's not validate (trust that `/asaf-init` already validates)

**Claude**: Good. What about migration and backward compatibility? Existing repo with sprints, no selection file, manually created wrong format?

**Developer**: yes (covered by auto-selection)

**Claude**: Perfect. We have 14 edge cases identified.

## Phase 4: Acceptance Criteria

**Claude**: Now let's define what "done" looks like. AC1: Auto-selection on first use - most recently modified sprint auto-selected, file created, command continues. Should we add logging/feedback?

**Developer**: yes

**Claude**: Good. AC2: Explicit selection - sprint becomes active, file updated, confirmation shown. Should we add "selection persists across commands"?

**Developer**: we don't have tests here. if you want tests please add them outside .claude/ directory and don't install them. also make sure that install.sh and uninstall.sh addresses the new files

**Claude**: Ah good clarification! I wasn't talking about automated test code - acceptance criteria are just testable success conditions (manual verification). But noted on automated tests.

**Claude**: AC2: Explicit selection - sprint becomes active AND selection persists. Good?

**Developer**: yes

**Claude**: AC3: Interactive selection - list shown with current highlighted, user can choose, selection updates. Good?

**Developer**: yes

**Claude**: AC4: Stale state recovery - detects deleted sprint, removes stale file, auto-selects, continues. Good?

**Developer**: yes

**Claude**: AC5: Status visibility - current sprint, type, and selection time displayed at top. Good?

**Developer**: yes

**Claude**: AC6: All commands respect selection - command operates on selected sprint only. Good?

**Developer**: yes

**Claude**: AC7: Backward compatibility - existing repos work without manual migration. Good?

**Developer**: yes

**Claude**: And one more - AC8: Init prompt behavior - user prompted after creating sprint, choice respected. Good?

**Developer**: yes

## Phase 5: Execution Planning

**Claude**: Almost done! This is a markdown-only project (no code). For executor, should we use general-purpose or custom "ASAF command writer" profile?

**Developer**: use general-purpose

**Claude**: Good. For reviewer mode (no personal goals found, default is Supportive Mentor): should reviewer focus on clarity, completeness, consistency, or all of the above?

**Developer**: all of the above

**Claude**: Perfect. For task patterns: this touches 16 files (1 new, 15 modified). Should we use standard 3 iterations per task, more for complex/fewer for simple, or variable based on complexity?

**Developer**: Variable based on complexity
