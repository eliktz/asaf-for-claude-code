# ASAF Summary Command

**Command**: `/asaf-summary`

**Purpose**: Generate executive summary of workspace tasks and overall progress

**Category**: Reporting & Analysis

---

## When to Use

Run `/asaf-summary` to get:
- Overview of all tasks in workspace
- Progress metrics and completion rates
- Active work highlights
- Blockers and risks
- Key insights and recommendations

**Best for**: Weekly standups, sprint reviews, executive updates, identifying patterns

---

## Step 0: Verify Active Sprint

1. Check if /asaf/.current-sprint.json exists
   - If NO: Run auto-selection algorithm (see asaf-core.md)
   - If YES: Read sprint name from file

2. Validate selected sprint exists at /asaf/<sprint-name>/
   - If NO: Sprint was deleted
     - Delete stale /asaf/.current-sprint.json
     - Log: "Selected sprint no longer exists, auto-selecting..."
     - Run auto-selection algorithm
   - If YES: Continue

3. Validate sprint has .state.json
   - Check /asaf/<sprint-name>/.state.json exists
   - If NO but sprint folder exists:
     - LENIENT WARNING: Log "Sprint has no .state.json (may be incomplete)"
     - Continue anyway (developer may be fixing)
   - If sprint folder missing: Already handled in step 2

4. Set context: All subsequent operations use /asaf/<sprint-name>/

---

## Prerequisites

**Required**:
- At least one task exists in workspace (check with `/asaf-list`)

**Files Read**:
- `asaf-state.json` - All task states
- `tasks/*/.task-state.json` - Individual task details
- `tasks/*/.retro.md` - Retrospective insights
- `tasks/*/.demo-notes.md` - Demo outcomes

---

## Command Behavior

### 1. Gather All Task Data

Read workspace state:
```json
{
  "workspaceId": "my-project",
  "tasks": {
    "feature-auth": { "state": "IMPLEMENTING", ...},
    "bug-fix-login": { "state": "COMPLETED", ...},
    "api-integration": { "state": "BLOCKED", ...}
  }
}
```

### 2. Calculate Metrics

Analyze tasks to determine:
- Total tasks: Count all tasks
- Active: GROOMING, IMPLEMENTING, REVIEWING states
- Completed: COMPLETED state
- Blocked: Tasks with blockers
- Completion rate: Completed / Total
- Average cycle time: From INIT to COMPLETED
- Velocity trend: Compare recent vs older completions

### 3. Identify Patterns

Detect:
- Common blocker types
- Tasks blocked by same issue
- Velocity changes
- Success/failure patterns

### 4. Generate Summary Report

Create comprehensive markdown summary

---

## Output Format

```markdown
# ASAF Workspace Summary
Generated: [timestamp]

## üìä Overview
- **Total Tasks**: X
- **Active**: X | **Completed**: X | **Blocked**: X
- **Overall Health**: [Excellent/Good/Needs Attention/Critical]

## üìà Key Metrics
- **Completion Rate**: X% (X of X tasks)
- **Average Cycle Time**: X days
- **Blocker Impact**: X tasks affected
- **Velocity Trend**: [Increasing/Stable/Decreasing]

## üöÄ Active Work Highlights

### High Priority
- **feature-user-authentication** - IMPLEMENTING (60% complete)
  - Phase: Implementation
  - Next: Complete JWT token generation

### In Progress
- **api-payment-integration** - GROOMING (Plan in review)
  - Waiting for: Grooming approval

## ‚úÖ Recent Completions (Last 7 Days)
- **bug-fix-login-timeout** - Completed Oct 7
  - Outcome: Reduced timeout errors by 95%
  - Demo: Successful
  
- **refactor-database-queries** - Completed Oct 5
  - Outcome: 40% performance improvement
  - Demo: Approved by team

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Blockers & Risks

### Active Blockers
1. **API_SECRET Environment Variable**
   - Affects: feature-user-authentication
   - Status: Waiting for DevOps team
   - Impact: Implementation paused
   - Action Needed: Follow up with DevOps

2. **Third-party API Downtime**
   - Affects: api-payment-integration
   - Status: Monitoring vendor status
   - Impact: Cannot test integration
   - Action Needed: Escalate to vendor

### Risk Analysis
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 2 tasks blocked by external dependencies
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Velocity decreased 20% this week
- ‚úÖ No critical technical debt accumulating

## üí° Insights & Recommendations

### What's Going Well
- High completion rate (85%) shows good task scoping
- No implementation failures in last 10 tasks
- Demo success rate: 100% (last 5 demos)

### Areas for Improvement
- Average blocker resolution time: 2.5 days (target: <1 day)
- 3 tasks waiting for grooming approval (suggest dedicated review time)
- External dependency blockers recurring (consider fallback strategies)

### Leadership Actions Needed
1. **Urgent**: Expedite API_SECRET setup (blocking critical feature)
2. **Important**: Schedule grooming review session (3 tasks waiting)
3. **Nice to Have**: Explore backup payment provider (reduce risk)

## üìö Retrospective Highlights

**Key Learnings** (from completed tasks):
- JWT implementation was more complex than estimated (factor 1.5x for auth)
- Database migration went smoothly with proper rollback plan
- Early reviewer involvement prevented rework

**Process Improvements**:
- Add "external dependency" flag during grooming
- Create blocker escalation SLA
- Schedule daily 10-min blocker review

---

**Workspace Health**: Good ‚úÖ  
(Minor blockers present but manageable, strong completion rate)

**Next Actions**:
1. Resolve 2 active blockers
2. Approve 3 pending grooming plans
3. Continue implementation on active tasks
