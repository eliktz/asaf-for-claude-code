# ASAF Implementation Feedback Command

**Command**: `/asaf-impl-feedback`

**Purpose**: Handle post-implementation changes with structured quality gates

**When to use**: After `/asaf-impl` completes and you have feedback, fixes, or improvements to apply

---

## Step 0: Verify Active Sprint

1. Check if /asaf/.current-sprint.json exists
   - If NO: Run auto-selection algorithm (see asaf-core.md)
   - If YES: Read sprint name from file

2. Validate selected sprint exists at /asaf/<sprint-name>/
   - If NO: Sprint was deleted
     - Delete stale /asaf/.current-sprint.json
     - Log: "Selected sprint no longer exists, auto-selecting..."
     - Run auto-selection algorithm
   - If YES: Continue

3. Validate sprint has .state.json
   - Check /asaf/<sprint-name>/.state.json exists
   - If NO but sprint folder exists:
     - LENIENT WARNING: Log "Sprint has no .state.json (may be incomplete)"
     - Continue anyway (developer may be fixing)
   - If sprint folder missing: Already handled in step 2

4. Set context: All subsequent operations use /asaf/<sprint-name>/

---

## Prerequisites

### Check Sprint State

Read `.state.json`:
- phase must be "implementation"
- OR phase must be "demo" (feedback after demo)
- OR phase must be "retro" (final feedback)

**If implementation not started**:
```
🔴 ERROR: Implementation not started

Current phase: [phase]

You must run /asaf-impl before collecting feedback.

Current sprint: [sprint-name]
Phase: [phase]

Options:
  /asaf-impl          - Start implementation
  /asaf-status        - Check sprint status
```
**STOP execution.**

**If implementation not complete yet**:
```
⚠️ WARNING: Implementation in progress

/asaf-impl is currently running (Task [X]/[N]).

You can still provide feedback, but it's recommended to wait until
implementation completes for a full review.

Continue with feedback now? (y/n)
```

---

## Opening Message

Show context as text:
```
📝 Post-Implementation Feedback

Implementation is complete. Let's collect and apply any changes needed.

I'll help you:
1. Review the implementation systematically (optional)
2. Collect all feedback in one place
3. Apply changes with quality checks (executor → reviewer loop)
4. Update documentation

This ensures feedback changes maintain the same quality as /asaf-impl.
```

**USE the AskUserQuestion tool** for mode selection:

```yaml
AskUserQuestion:
  questions:
    - question: "How would you like to provide feedback?"
      header: "Mode"
      multiSelect: false
      options:
        - label: "Interactive Review"
          description: "I'll walk through each task (systematic, thorough)"
        - label: "Bulk Feedback"
          description: "You provide all feedback now (fast, if already reviewed)"
        - label: "Specific Changes"
          description: "You have exact changes to make (fastest, expert users)"
```

**Map response**:
- "Interactive Review" → Mode 1
- "Bulk Feedback" → Mode 2
- "Specific Changes" → Mode 3

---

## Mode 1: Interactive Review

### Step 1: Task-by-Task Review

```
Let's review the implementation task by task.

[Read implementation/tasks.md to get task list]
[Read implementation/progress.md to get completion status]

Total tasks: [N]
Completed: [X]
```

**For each completed task**:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Task [N]: [Task Name]

**Complexity**: [X] story points
**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Iterations**: [Y] (max: [Z])

**Files Modified**:
- [file1] ([lines changed])
- [file2] ([lines changed])

**Edge Cases Handled**:
[List from progress.md]

**Tests**:
✅ [X] tests passing
[If any failures]: ⚠️ [Y] tests failing

**Reviewer Notes** (from last iteration):
[Last reviewer feedback from progress.md]

---

Any feedback on this task?
(Type your comments, or press Enter to skip to next task)

You: [user input]
```

**Collect all feedback** before executing.

After reviewing all tasks:

```
Review complete!

Collected [N] feedback items across [X] tasks.

Ready to proceed with applying feedback? (y/n)
```

---

## Mode 2: Bulk Feedback

```
Please provide all your feedback (one item per line or paragraph):

Format suggestions:
- "Task 1: [feedback]"
- "[file.ts]: [feedback]"
- "[General]: [feedback]"

You can paste from your notes, GitHub comments, etc.

Enter your feedback (type 'done' on a new line when finished):
```

**Collect all input until user types "done".**

---

## Mode 3: Specific Changes

```
Please provide specific changes you want to make:

Format:
- "Fix [issue] in [file]"
- "Add [feature] to [component]"
- "Refactor [code] for [reason]"

You: [user provides list]
```

---

## Categorize Feedback

After collecting feedback (any mode):

```
Analyzing feedback...

[Parse each feedback item]
[Determine severity based on keywords: "bug", "broken", "error" = Bug]
[Determine severity based on keywords: "improve", "better", "refactor" = Improvement]
[Determine severity based on keywords: "add", "would be nice", "consider" = Enhancement]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Feedback Summary:

🔴 BUGS (must fix):
1. [Task X]: [Description]
2. [Task Y]: [Description]
Total: [N] bugs

🟡 IMPROVEMENTS (should fix):
1. [Task X]: [Description]
2. [Task Y]: [Description]
Total: [N] improvements

🟢 ENHANCEMENTS (nice to have):
1. [Task X]: [Description]
Total: [N] enhancements

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Total feedback items: [N]
```

**USE the AskUserQuestion tool** for scope selection:

```yaml
AskUserQuestion:
  questions:
    - question: "Which items should I address?"
      header: "Scope"
      multiSelect: false
      options:
        - label: "Fix all"
          description: "Bugs + improvements + enhancements"
        - label: "Bugs + improvements"
          description: "Skip nice-to-have enhancements"
        - label: "Bugs only"
          description: "Critical issues only"
        - label: "Custom selection"
          description: "I'll choose specific items"
```

**If "Custom selection"**, present multi-select:

```yaml
AskUserQuestion:
  questions:
    - question: "Which specific items should I fix?"
      header: "Items"
      multiSelect: true
      options:
        - label: "[Item 1 description]"
          description: "[Category: Bug/Improvement/Enhancement]"
        - label: "[Item 2 description]"
          description: "[Category]"
        # ... dynamically generated from feedback list
```

## Error Handling

### No Implementation to Provide Feedback On

```
🔴 ERROR: No implementation to provide feedback on

Current sprint: [sprint-name]
Phase: [phase]

Implementation hasn't been completed yet.

Options:
  /asaf-impl       - Start/continue implementation
  /asaf-status     - Check current status
```

---

### Test Failures During Feedback

If tests fail after applying feedback:

```
⚠️ WARNING: Tests failing after feedback change

Feedback item [N]: [Description]

Test failures:
- [test1]: [error]
- [test2]: [error]

The executor will attempt to fix these issues.

[Executor analyzes failures and fixes]

[Re-run tests]

[If still failing after 3 attempts]

🔴 BLOCKED: Cannot complete feedback item

Feedback item [N] could not be completed due to test failures.
```

**USE the AskUserQuestion tool**:

```yaml
AskUserQuestion:
  questions:
    - question: "How should we proceed with this blocked item?"
      header: "Action"
      multiSelect: false
      options:
        - label: "Skip and continue"
          description: "Skip this item, proceed with other feedback"
        - label: "Stop iteration"
          description: "Manual intervention needed, pause here"
        - label: "Mark incomplete"
          description: "Mark as incomplete, continue with others"
```

---

### Reviewer Rejects Changes

If reviewer rejects feedback changes:

```
❌ REVIEW FAILED

Feedback item [N]: [Description]

Reviewer found issues:
- [Issue 1]
- [Issue 2]

The executor will address these issues.

[Executor iteration]

[Re-review]

[If fails again]

⚠️ WARNING: Feedback item requires multiple iterations

This feedback change is more complex than expected.

Continue iterating? (max 3 iterations per item) (y/n)
```

---

### No Feedback Provided

If user provides empty feedback:

```
No feedback provided.

It looks like you don't have any changes to make right now.

Implementation is complete and approved!

Options:
  /asaf-demo       - Generate demo presentation
  /asaf-retro      - Run retrospective when ready
```

---

## Design Notes

### Why This Command Exists

**Problem**: After `/asaf-impl`, users provide feedback in ad-hoc conversations. Changes are made without:
- Reviewer oversight
- Edge case validation
- Test updates
- Documentation

Result: Quality degrades.

**Solution**: Structured feedback with same rigor as implementation.

### Key Principles

1. **Quality Gates**: Every feedback change goes through executor → test → reviewer
2. **Documentation**: All feedback tracked in progress.md
3. **Categorization**: Bugs vs improvements vs enhancements (prioritization)
4. **Multiple Rounds**: Can run feedback multiple times
5. **Flexible Input**: Interactive review, bulk feedback, or specific changes

### Comparison to /asaf-impl

| Aspect | /asaf-impl | /asaf-impl-feedback |
|--------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Input** | tasks.md (planned) | User feedback (reactive) |
| **Scope** | All planned tasks | Specific changes |
| **Iterations** | Max per task | Max per feedback item |
| **Quality** | High (executor → reviewer) | High (same loop) |
| **Documentation** | progress.md | progress.md (feedback section) |

Both maintain ASAF quality standards.

## Future Enhancements (Not in v1)

- Auto-review: Claude suggests improvements proactively
- Feedback templates: Common feedback patterns (performance, error messages, etc.)
- Diff viewer: Show before/after for each change
- Undo: Rollback specific feedback changes
- Batch export: Export all feedback as GitHub issues

---

_This command ensures post-implementation quality matches implementation quality._
