### Phase 1: Overall Experience (2-3 min)

**Questions to explore**:

1. "How did this sprint feel overall? On a scale of 1-10, how would you rate the experience?"

2. "What stands out to you most about this sprint?"

3. [If rating is low] "What made it challenging?"

1. "What are you most proud of from this sprint?"

2. "Which part of the process was most valuable?"
   - Grooming conversation?
   - Implementation automation?
   - Code review cycles?
   - Something else?

3. "Were there any 'aha moments' or breakthroughs?"

4. [If tasks completed quickly] "Task [X] went perfectly on first try. What made that work well?"

5. [If high test coverage] "You achieved [X]% test coverage. How did that feel?"

**Document positives** for what-went-well.md

---

### Phase 3: What Could Be Improved (3-4 min)

**Questions to explore**:

1. "What was harder than expected?"

2. [If tasks required multiple iterations] "Task [X] needed [Y] iterations. What made it challenging?"

4. "If you could change one thing about this sprint, what would it be?"

5. [If grooming took long] "Grooming took [X] minutes. Was that time well spent, or could it be shorter?"

6. "Did the code review feedback help you, or was it confusing?"

**Document improvements** for improvements.md

---

### Phase 4: Learning & Growth (3-4 min)

**Connect to personal goals**:

1. [Reference personal goal] "You wanted to learn [goal]. Did this sprint help with that?"

2. "What's the most important thing you learned technically?"
   - New pattern?
   - Library/tool?
   - Best practice?
   - Debugging technique?

3. "What did you learn about the development process?"
   - Planning better?
   - Testing approach?
   - Communication?

4. "Is there something you want to explore deeper based on this sprint?"

**Document learnings** for learnings.md

---

### Phase 5: Personal Goals Update (2-3 min)

**Review progress on goals**:

1. [For each goal] "Your goal was '[goal]'. How much progress did you make?"
   - Achieved (ready to move on)
   - In Progress (made progress, need more)
   - No Progress (didn't focus on this)

2. "Do you want to add any new learning goals based on this experience?"

3. "Should we update your reviewer preferences?"
   - If learned a lot: Maybe want more challenge (Harsh Critic)
   - If struggled: Maybe want more support (Educational)

**Prepare personal goal updates**
